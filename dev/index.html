            Programs are facilitated and dedicated to engage individuals
            with a wide range of mental health issues including but not
            limited to Autism Spectrum Disorders, psychological

            unique and interactive strategies of Behind the Line augment

            Behind the Line and
            <a href="//saaac.org">South Asian Autism Awareness Centre</a> are
            partnering up with talented and professional Canadian artists to
            raise funds for the SAAAC Creative: an art program supporting
            individuals with autism.

            SAAAC Creative is a visual arts initiative that aims to
            inspire creativity, enhance cognitive abilities and promote
            social inclusion through artistic exploration and
            professional skill development.   Our participants work
            towards creating vibrant works of art to change perceptions,
            raise awareness and beautify our communities.  Our main
            objective is to promote public awareness of the creative
            capacity and potential of individuals with Autism, while
            enhancing participants’ sense of social inclusion through
            artistic recognition.
