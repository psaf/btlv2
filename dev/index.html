					      <h1>What's a Social Enterprise?</h1>
					      <p class="intro">A social enterprise is an organization that applies commercial strategies to maximize improvements in human and environmental well-being, rather than maximizing profits for external shareholders.</p>

					      <p class="body">Many commercial enterprises would consider themselves to have social objectives, but commitment to these objectives is motivated by the perception that such commitment will ultimately make the enterprise more financially valuable. Social enterprises differ in that, inversely, they do not aim to offer any benefit to their investors, except where they believe that doing so will ultimately further their capacity to realize their social and environmental goals.</p>

					      <p class="body">Canadian social enterprise characteristics vary by region and province in the ways they differentiate social enterprises from other types of businesses, not-for-profits, co-operatives and government agencies:</p>

					      <p class="body point">
					      	Social enterprises may directly address social needs through their products and services, the number of people they employ or the use of their financial surplus. This can distinguish them from "socially responsible for-profit businesses", which create positive social change indirectly through the practice of corporate social responsibility (e.g., creating and implementing a charitable foundation; paying fair wages to their employees; using environmentally friendly raw materials; providing volunteers to help with community projects).
					      </p>

					      <p class="body point">
					      	Social enterprises may use earned revenue strategies to pursue a double or triple bottom line, either alone (as a social economy business, in either the private or the not-for-profit sector) or as a significant part of a not-for-profit corporation's mixed income stream that may include charitable contributions and public sector assistance. This distinguishes them from some traditional not-for-profit corporations, which may rely in whole or part on charitable and government support.
					      </p>

					      <p class="body">
					      	Significant regional differences in legislation, financing, support agencies and corporate structures can be seen across Canada as a result of different historical development paths in the social economy. Common regional characteristics can be seen in British Columbia, the Prairies, Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada.

						<h3 class="strategy-header">CREATIVITY IS THE KEY</h3>
						<p class="strategy-content">Innovative and creative thinking is a skill and like most skills it must be developed through training and practice. The challenges that we will face as a society in the very near future will require a high level of creative problem solving and ingenuity. The leaders of tomorrow will be those that possess those skills; individuals that can re-imagine systems, processes, trends, and complex structures and develop strategies to address inherent and shifting challenges. More industries are beginning to understand the value of creative and innovative thinkers and as such we must work to promote artistic endeavors to the youth of today and the future generations.</p>

						<div class="icon"><span class="icon-earth"></span></div>
						<h3 class="strategy-header">BIG PICTURE &amp; BABY STEPS</h3>
						<p class="strategy-content">The biggest obstacle that we face is the first step: overcoming the feeling of beingoverwhelmed. Complex issues can often require complex solutions; however we need to learn to crawl before we can learn to walk. We need to take baby steps and understand that although we do not have all the answers we possess pieces of the puzzle. We need to plant the seeds with an engagement model of education that will inspire rather than alienate our youth. We need to expand our sense of empathy through time and leave a legacy of wisdom rather than ignorance.</p>

					<div class="strategy">
						<div class="icon"><span class="icon-cool"></span></div>
						<h3 class="strategy-header">SUPPORT LOCAL TALENT</h3>
						<p class="strategy-content">Less than a few generations ago if you were a moderately talented artist, musician, philosopher or thinker you were valued and inspired. Today there is no “middleclass” for creative thinkers, either you are a “starving artist” or excessively wealthy. Creative minds now have to compete with the entire world in order to receive any recognition, and as a result are dying out. Educated and motivated minds in the arts and social sector are often forced into menial undertakings for years before they can be truly provided with an opportunity to impart change and realize their visions. As a result talented minds change or leave their sector to pursuit more financially viable opportunities and we all lose what could have potentially significant voices in our communities.</p>
